> Understood! If you're building a console-based sampler, your first step will be to design the text-based interface. Here are some suggestions:
> 
> Design the command syntax: Determine the commands that users will be able to input and the syntax for those commands. For example, you might have commands for loading samples, adjusting playback parameters, and applying effects.
> 
> Parse user input: Write code to parse the user input and perform the appropriate actions. For example, if the user inputs "load sample1.wav", you'll need to write code to load the sample file "sample1.wav" and store it in memory.
> 
> Implement a REPL loop: Write a loop that reads user input, parses the input, and performs the appropriate actions. This is called a REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop) and is a common pattern for console-based applications.
> 
> Output results: When appropriate, output the results of your actions to the console. For example, you might output the current volume level after the user adjusts it.
>
> Implement error handling: Be sure to implement error handling to catch invalid inputs and prevent your program from crashing. You should also consider logging errors to help you debug your program.
